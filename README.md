# File :- arrayRemoveDuplicate #

QUESTION :- Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

# File :- maxSumOfContiguousElements #

Question :  Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.
   For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.
   Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.
   Do this in O(N) time.
